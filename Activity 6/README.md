### Recipe Website

1. I used the `container-fluid` class as it gives the website a better look as compared to `container`
2. The `input` fields are wrapped in a `row` to show `columns`
3. The bootstrap components I decided to use were:

- `Jumbotron`
- `Buttons`
- `Inputs` 
- `Cards`

4. The website shrinks to show one column on mobile phones.

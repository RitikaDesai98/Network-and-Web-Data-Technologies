# INFSCI2560 Activity Two

This week you need to need to create a single recipe web-page by coding the HTML and CSS. The content of the web page is the provided in the `recipe.txt` file that is part of this project (look in the file browswer).

1. Remix this glitch app to create your own copy.
2. Open the reference sources (below) in another browser tab.
   - [MDN HTML element reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) for a concise reference on HTML tags.
   - [MDN CSS referece](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference) for an exhausive reference on CSS.
3. Copy over the `recipe.txt` file contents into your `index.html` file. Feel free to reorder the text to your liking. Edit the `index.html` and add structure to the recipe text. It must contain the following: 
   1. At least two heading tags (h1, h2, h3) 
   2. Two paragraphs (p) of text with some inline tags (strong, em) 
   3. Embed a muffin [image](https://unsplash.com/search/photos/muffin). 
   4. Use a list (ol, ul, li) for the recipe ingredients and directions.
4. Edit the `style.css` and apply the following styles to your document:
   1. Specify the font / typeface for your document
   2. Specify the size of the headers and paragraph text
   3. Apply a style to the image in the document
   4. Apply a style to each li item in one of your lists

5) Use [The W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate your website (the public URL which will look like {project-name}.glitch.me) and ensure you have correct markup.
6) Once it is valid, submit the Glitch project URL (it will end with ~{project-name}) on Canvas.

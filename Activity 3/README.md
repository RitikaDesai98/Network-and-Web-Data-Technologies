# INFSCI2560 Activity Three

This week you need to need to modify and create JavaScript to add interactivity to the project's webpage. I have created four buttons on the page and I want you to write some JavaScript that accomplishes the following tasks belo

provided some javascript boilerplate, so it will be your task to  

## Four Tasks

1. **Selecting Elements** - Display the text content of the HTML element specified in the HTML. Display the text on the Javascript console. Look at the HTML source for Task One to see the element in question.
2. **Styling Tables** - Add a CSS class "even" to the even numbered rows in a table so the table has alternating colors.
3. **Modify Grocery List** - Insert new elements into a grocery list. Bonus, cross out at least one existing item ([hint](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_text_text-decoration.asp)). 
4. **Adding Interactivity** - Write a new function that does whatever you would like and attach it to the 4th button. This could change the CSS, add new HTML elements, or do something wild with Javascript.

## Steps

1. Remix this glitch app to create your own copy.
2. Edit `script.js` and modify the code to accomplish each of the four tasks. I have provided some boilerplate for the first three tasks so you don't need to worry about attaching functions to the button's event listener.
3. Use [The W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate your website (the public URL which will look like {project-name}.glitch.me) and ensure you have correct markup.
4. Once it is valid, submit the Glitch project URL (it will end with ~{project-name}) on Canvas.

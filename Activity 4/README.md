# INFSCI2560 Activity Four


This week you will be playing around with forms, media and HTML5 APIs. You will create a form (using the requirements below) that asks the user for some information, performs some validation and then stores that information in the browsers local storage.

## Your Task

1. Create a HTML form - Should include atleast 3 input elements and a submit button. Use the list below to provide ideas. 
2. Validate the information - Use Javascript to check at least 2 fields in your form and ensure it conforms to the desired format (As a best practice, you should specify the validation criteria in your form). This could be as simple as making sure the user didn't leave a required field blank or checking to make sure an email address has an @ symbol. You will probably need to use [JavaScript string methods](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_string.asp)
3. Save the data - Use the localStorage (or if you are feeling ambitious try the [IndexedDB API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) to save the data collected by the form in the browser. The information should persist across sessions!
4. Test that you are able to load the data . On subsequent page loads, write some Javascript that adds the data saved in localstorage to the page. This can be anywhere on the page.
5. Added challenge - Write some CSS so that the form doesn't look horribly ugly. 

Some ideas if you are having a hard time thinking of what to make:
- A todo list (at the least one that only lets you add items)
- A grocery list
- A note taking app
- A contact form
- An address book that validates phone numbers

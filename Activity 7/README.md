Activity 7
=================

The purpose of this activity is to allow you to play around with promises and the Fetch API in JavaScript. Your task is to create a simple GET request using the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/) and then display the results.
* First, read the documentation on the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/documentation) so that you know how to use it.
* Use the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) to get 10 random users (i.e. each time I load the page, I should see different users). NOTE: the documentation gives a JQuery example, but you should use the Fetch API instead.
* Display a list or table (your choice) with the user's picture, first and last name.
* Use CSS to make your page look nicer. You should definitely change the font-family and provide some style to your list or table. You might want to play around with the [border-radius](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_rounded_images.asp) property to add rounded corners to each image, use CSS to place images side-by-side using the [float](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_images_side_by_side.asp) property or anything else.
